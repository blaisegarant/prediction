## Gathering the data

Let's first gather the data. The dataset have been already separated in two sets that we'll call `testing` and `training`. 
```{r data_setup}
if (!file.exists('pml-training.csv')){
  download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", 'pml-training.csv')
}
if (!file.exists('pml-testing.csv')){
  download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", 'pml-testing.csv')
}
testing<-read.csv('pml-testing.csv')
training<-read.csv('pml-training.csv')
```

According to the assignment and the documentation of the study, the variable to predict is the `classe` variable in which class A is a good practice and other classes are commun mistakes.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
